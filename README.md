UPC Integrity validator written in Clojure
===

Just a Clojure library I've tried to write while learning Clojure :sparkling_heart:

Usage
------

It's not working but you can try to use it, lol.

```clojure
(require 'upc-integrity.core)
(upc-integrity.core/check-upc-integrity "013800151735") ; => true
```

Tests
-----

Just run:

```bash
$ lein test
```

btw, they're failing :grin:

Is it done?
-----------
No way :wrench:.
